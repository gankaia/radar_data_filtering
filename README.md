# radar_data_filtering

This code implements data filtering on low-quality radar.

The radar data includes attributes such as vehicle ID, world coordinates(x, y) and timestamps, with a frame rate 13 fps. Due to device failures, the vehicle ID was recorded up to 99, so there is an overlap of trajectories.
